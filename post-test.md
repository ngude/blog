Hello viewer, thank you for being here. We are returning to blog.

Resurrecting the antiquated blog format has been on our minds for a long time now. We didn't want to use a modern era "social newsletter" platform like s_bstack or the like because they all feel so bloated, focused on the social/monetization aspect, and ultimately to capture and capitalize on its viewership. Regardless of whether that's actually true or not, we're not really ones to do things rationally or logically for better or for worse. Finally after several Very Silly Tulip's Styled attempts over the years we've finally managed to self-host and self-publish something to the public facing World Wide Web for no reason other than to put something out there.

In the coming months we'll be catching this site up on various happenings over the last 2 years of our existence and then finally switch from our main source of updates (ig) to this being our main source of updates to you. We anticipate our overall viewership to drastically diminish compared to ig but that's OK. If anyone decides to view this page at all, we will be eternally grateful. Our ig will not be disappearing but it will be used for 100% shit posting instead of 90% shit posting.q
